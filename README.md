# Customer Management

**Status**: In progress ðŸš§

This is a customer management project developed using Python and a layered architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to organize and process data efficiently. The main goal is to create a robust pipeline for managing and analyzing customer information.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.12**
- **Streamlit**: For building user interfaces and data visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Poetry**: For dependency and virtual environment management.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database connection and querying.

## Layered Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture to process data incrementally and organize it into different refinement levels:

### Bronze Layer
- Responsible for extracting raw data from the database.
- Converts data into DataFrames for further processing.

### Silver Layer
- Processes data from the Bronze Layer, performing cleaning and validation.
- Adds structure and organization to the data.

### Gold Layer
- Applies final transformations and enrichments.
- Data is ready for analysis or visualization.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
    ```

2. Install dependencies with Poetry:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    poetry install
    ```

3. Set up the environment:
   - Create a `.env` file with the necessary database connection details.

   Example `.env` file:
    ```bash
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
    ```

4. Run the pipeline:
    - Use the `app.py` file to execute the pipeline or visualize the data with Streamlit:
    ```bash
    cd customer-management 
    run following commands: streamlit run app.py or task run
    ```

## Next Steps
- Create Admin module
- Write tests for the pipeline.
